# TodoListTestProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1.  [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
    Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    npm install


Run the following commands in two separate terminals.

The first one will start a back-end running at port 8000:

    npm run-script serve

The second will start a front-end running at port 4200:

    npm start

Npm is also used to manage dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `npm update` and `npm install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `npm help update`.

The `npm run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

### Managing dependencies

To add a library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:

    npm install <library_name>

To add a library as a development dependency, you would run following command:

    npm install --save-dev <library_name>


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
